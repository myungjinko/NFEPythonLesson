## Real-World Analogy: Recipe vs Code

### Making a Sandwich:

**Recipe (Human Instructions):**
1. Take two slices of bread
2. Spread mayonnaise on one slice
3. Add lettuce, tomato, and cheese
4. Put the other slice on top
5. Cut diagonally

**Code (Computer Instructions):**
```python
def make_sandwich():
    bread1 = get_bread_slice()
    bread2 = get_bread_slice()
    spread_mayonnaise(bread1)
    add_lettuce(bread1)
    add_tomato(bread1)
    add_cheese(bread1)
    place_bread(bread2, bread1)
    cut_sandwich_diagonally()
```

---

## Chapter 6: Variables

### Learning Objectives:
- Understand what variables are
- Learn how to create and use variables
- Discover different data types

### What are Variables?
Variables are like containers that store information in your program.

### Creating Variables:
```python
name = 'Alice'
age = 25
height = 5.6
is_student = True
```

### Data Types:
- **Strings**: Text (like 'Hello')
- **Integers**: Whole numbers (like 42)
- **Floats**: Decimal numbers (like 3.14)
- **Booleans**: True or False

### Variable Rules:
- Use descriptive names
- Start with letters or underscore
- No spaces (use underscores)

---

## Chapter 7: Code Blocks

### Learning Objectives:
- Understand how code is organized
- Learn about indentation and structure
- Discover how to group related code

### What are Code Blocks?
Code blocks are groups of related instructions that work together.

### Indentation:
Python uses indentation (spaces) to show which code belongs together:
```python
if temperature > 80:
    print('It is hot!')
    print('Wear sunscreen')
print('This is not in the if block')
```

### Block Types:
- Function blocks
- Conditional blocks (if/else)
- Loop blocks
- Class blocks

### Important:
- Use consistent indentation
- Usually 4 spaces per level
- Don't mix tabs and spaces

---

## Chapter 8: Functions

### Learning Objectives:
- Understand what functions are
- Learn how to create and use functions
- Discover function parameters and return values

### What are Functions?
Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks.

### Creating Functions:
```python
def greet(name):
    print(f'Hello, {name}!')
    return 'Greeting sent'

# Using the function
result = greet('Alice')
```

### Function Parts:
- **def**: Keyword to define a function
- **Function name**: What you call it
- **Parameters**: Information the function needs
- **Body**: The code that runs
- **Return**: What the function gives back

### Why Use Functions?
- Reuse code
- Organize your program
- Make code easier to understand

---

## Chapter 9: If/Else Statements

### Learning Objectives:
- Understand conditional logic
- Learn how to make decisions in code
- Discover comparison operators

### What are If/Else Statements?
If/else statements let your program make decisions based on conditions.

### Basic Structure:
```python
if condition:
    # do this if condition is True
elif another_condition:
    # do this if another_condition is True
else:
    # do this if no conditions are True
```

### Comparison Operators:
- **==** (equal to)
- **!=** (not equal to)
- **>** (greater than)
- **<** (less than)
- **>=** (greater than or equal)
- **<=** (less than or equal)

### Example:
```python
age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print('You are an adult')
else:
    print('You are a minor')
```

---

## Chapter 10: Loops

### Learning Objectives:
- Understand what loops are
- Learn about for and while loops
- Discover how to repeat code efficiently

### What are Loops?
Loops let you repeat code multiple times without writing it over and over.

### For Loops:
```python
for item in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:
    print(item)

for i in range(5):
    print(f'Count: {i}')
```

### While Loops:
```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(f'Count: {count}')
    count += 1
```

### Loop Control:
- **break**: Stop the loop early
- **continue**: Skip to next iteration
- **range()**: Generate sequences of numbers

### When to Use:
- **For loops**: When you know how many times
- **While loops**: When you don't know how many times

def play_rps():
    choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']
    computer = random.choice(choices)
    player = input('Rock, paper, or scissors? ').lower()
    
    if player not in choices:
        print('Invalid choice!')
        return
    
    print(f'Computer chose: {computer}')
    
    if player == computer:
        print('Tie!')
    elif (player == 'rock' and computer == 'scissors') or \
         (player == 'paper' and computer == 'rock') or \
         (player == 'scissors' and computer == 'paper'):
        print('You win!')
    else:
        print('Computer wins!')

while True:
    play_rps()
    if input('Play again? (y/n): ').lower() != 'y':
        break
```
